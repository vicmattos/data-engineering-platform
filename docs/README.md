# Documentation Type

I chose to follow the [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/), and will let it's documentation explain more than I will here, but the general idea is that there are 4 types of documentation. Each of these are different and are written with different aims in mind.

|             | Tutorials                          | How-to guides                        | Reference                         | Explanation                           |
|-------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **oriented to** | learning                           | a goal                               | information                       | understanding                         |
| **must**        | allow the newcomer to get started  | show how to solve a specific problem | describe the machinery            | explain                               |
| **its form**    | a lesson                           | a series of steps                    | dry description                   | discursive explanation                |
| **analogy**     | teaching a small child how to cook | a recipe in a cookery book           | a reference encyclopaedia article | an article on culinary social history |
